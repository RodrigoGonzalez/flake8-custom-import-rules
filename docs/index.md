# flake8-custom-import-rules

A ``flake8`` plugin that enforces custom import rules, allowing users to define and
maintain clean and consistent import organization across their Python projects.

## Motivation

This ``flake8`` plugin is extremely useful for enforcing custom import rules and
maintaining a consistent import organization across Python projects. By
allowing users to define specific restrictions, standalone packages, and import
rules, this plugin helps to prevent unwanted dependencies and ensures a clear
separation between high-level and low-level packages. Furthermore, it aids in
managing lightweight packages by restricting them to import only from the
Python standard library or third-party libraries, keeping them free
from unnecessary dependencies.

This plugin not only enhances code readability and maintainability but also
encourages a modular architecture that is easier to understand, test, and debug.
As a result, developers can effortlessly adhere to best practices, ensuring
their projects remain clean, well-organized, and optimized for efficient
collaboration.

In today's digital age, with the prolific production of code at many
organizations and the increasing number of contributors to various projects,
one of the significant challenges we face is the maintainability and
comprehensibility of code. Ensuring consistent and clean code is not merely
an aesthetic or pedantic pursuit; it directly impacts the efficiency of
onboarding new team members and the associated costs. Misunderstandings and
inconsistencies in code can lead to miscommunication, errors, and increased
time spent onboarding and training new staff. By enforcing custom import
rules and maintaining a consistent import organization across Python projects,
we can significantly mitigate these issues, streamlining the process of
integrating new team members and maintaining the high quality and readability
of our codebase.
