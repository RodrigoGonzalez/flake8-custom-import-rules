# Glossary
Welcome to the "Glossary," a comprehensive guide to
understanding key concepts and terminology in the
`flake8-custom-import-rules` package.

### Python Modules
Definition: A module is a single file containing Python
code. It can contain functions, variables, classes, and
runnable code. Essentially, any Python file with a `.py`
extension is a module.

Purpose: Modules are used to organize code into reusable
and manageable chunks. By putting related functions and
variables into a module, you can import them into other
Python files.

Example: A file named `mymodule.py` containing functions
and classes related to mathematical operations.

### Python Packages
Definition: A package is a directory that contains
multiple module files and a special `__init__.py` file.
The presence of `__init__.py` (which can be empty) tells
Python that the directory should be considered a package.

Purpose: Packages are used to organize multiple modules
into a hierarchical namespace. This allows for structuring
your code in a way that groups related modules together,
making it more maintainable and scalable.

Example: A directory named mypackage containing several
module files related to different aspects of data
processing, and an `__init__.py` file to signify it as a
package.
